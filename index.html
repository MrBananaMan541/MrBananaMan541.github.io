                <h3>My Education</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am earning my degree in Game Design & Development at Rochester Institute of Technology.
                    I am currently focusing on game design and development.
                    I have also taken a course in web development, and understand some aspects of web design.

                <h3>My Skills</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am proficient in C#, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Unity.
                    I also have some knowledge in C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    Additionally, I have some experience with Maya, Substance 3D Painter, and Godot.

                <h3>My Experience</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have studied as a game design & development major for the past 3 years, creating simple games and
                    programs that
                    handle some of the basic functions of coding.
                    I am also interested in the creation of art and assets for personal use and for projects for my
                    classes, like the
                    image above.

            <h3>Sweet Illusions</h3><br>
            A game I made with a team of 4 other people during my Game Development & Algorithmic Problem Solving 2 class during my freshman year. 
            I primarily helped by adding sound and music to the game, making the prototype for the player jumping and falling mechanics, 
            implementing an Finite State Machine (FSM) for the state of the game world, and also polishing some of the code to be more presentable. 
            This was also the first 2D game I ever made, as well as the first official game I have ever made.

            <h3>Tiny Problems</h3><br>
            A game I made by myself for my 2D Animation and Asset Production class during my freshman year. 
            The game was based on a template for making a 2D platformer in Unity, and all of the preexisting textures and animations had to be 
            replaced with custom made ones, as well as some of the sounds.
            <br><br><h3>Neglect</h3><br>
            A game I made by myself for my 3D Animation and Asset Production class during my sophmore year. 
            This was made from scratch, and used a basic texture plain for the floor and grayboxing for the walls and ceiling, but I made custom props 
            in Maya to put in, such as chairs, tables, exit signs, and ceiling fans that featured a simple animation of constantly spinning slowly. 
            This was also the first 3D game I ever made.

            <h3>Peaceland</h3><br>
            In 2024, from May 20th to August 1st, I was a part of an entrepreneurial co-op at RIT, where we had to build a playable game prototype, 
            called "Peaceland". The goal of Peaceland is to encourage people in post-conflict areas to be more empathetic to create peace, as well as 
            help show the player that the choices they make can have significant impacts on others. Working with some fellow game developers, I helped 
            work on the level design on the game, as well as creating some 3D assets to use. I also helped iron out any bugs that were found, and helped 
            to implement cutscenes and conversations. I was also part Rigger/Animator, along with being a Game Developer, and helped rig the 
            default character model, create some animations, and implement them into the game. I also did some voice acting and created some basic 
            dialogue for one of the fictional languages in the game, as well as some other background talking noises, although they have been archived and 
            are unused now. I have continued on the project as it turned into a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) during the following fall 2024 semester. 
            I have helped with doing research on other games that have similar narratives, controls, and other gameplay/narrative elements, in order to see 
            how we should continue developing Peaceland, and what we can apply to the game. Then during the spring 2025 semester, development started on 
            creating a simple prototype for one gameplay scene in 2D, and will be used as a guideline for future work on developing Peaceland. 
            The link below goes to the RIT webpage where you can learn more about Peaceland, and how it has developed over time.

            <h3>Quoth the Raven</h3><br>
            Quoth the Raven is the first game I ever made in Godot, although I did use the .NET version so I could continue using C# to code, and not 
            spend time learning a new language while developing the game. I worked in a team of 4 other people during my Game Design & Development 2 
            class during the fall semester of 2024. I primarily worked on the code and the design of the game, as well as creating a few temporary art 
            assets between some of the development sprints, most of which were replaced by official assets later. I primarily worked on implementing 
            player movement, controls, and other smaller mechanics/methods that deal with the player, and I also worked on implementing powerups that 
            would affect certain stats that the player has, such as sprint speed, health, and damage. I also helped to work on a rudimentary inventory 
            to view your stats and the current weapon you are holding, and I also helped to work on creating a basic win condition that keeps track of 
            the number of enemies killed out of all of them, and then a win screen once all the enemies were defeated. I also worked on smaller changes 
            to the code, and worked on fixing any bugs that would suddenly appear. The link below goes to the official web page for the game, where you 
            can learn more about the game and its current progress, and there is also a link to an itch.io page where you can download the latest version 
            of the game and play it for yourself (there is still an issue where some hallways line up incorrectly and may block player movement, as well 
            as the fact that there are doorways in most rooms that aren't blocked off, where the enemies can wander out of and escape, making it near 
            impossible to actually win at the moment).
